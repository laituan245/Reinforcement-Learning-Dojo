# Reinforcement Learning Dojo

This repository contains my code for popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. All code is written in Python 2.7 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Any feedback is appreciated. I am a noob in RL.

1. [Cross-Entropy Method for Cart-Pole Balancing](https://github.com/laituan245/Reinforcement-Learning-Dojo/tree/master/cross_entropy)

2. [Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for Playing Pong](https://github.com/laituan245/Reinforcement-Learning-Dojo/tree/master/dqn)

3. Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C) Algorithm for Playing Flappy Bird (In Progress)
